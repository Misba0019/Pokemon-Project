# Pok√©mon Gallery
## Overview
This project creates a simple Pok√©mon gallery displaying the first 151 Pok√©mon. It fetches and displays images of each Pok√©mon along with their respective numbers using data from the [Pok√©API](https://github.com/PokeAPI/sprites).  
To avoid rate-limiting issues, a delay is added between requests when fetching the images.

## Features

- **Rate-Limit Friendly**:  
A delay is implemented between requests to ensure compliance with the PokeAPI's rate-limiting policies.

- **Responsive Layout**:  
Ensures side-by-side display of Pok√©mon images, adapting to screen sizes.

- **Styled Appearance**:  
Custom fonts, colors, and alignment for a visually appealing look.
